# Git Stash Assignments 

***

## Assignment A - Practical
**Title:** “My First Stash”


***

### Task A1 — Basic Stash (10 mins)

1. On `main`:
   - Edit `README.md`.
   - Create `notes.txt` (don’t add it to Git).

2. Run:
   ```bash
   git stash
   git stash -u
   git stash list
   ```
   - Take 1 screenshot of `git stash list`.

3. Answer in `assignmentA.md`:
   - Q1: How many stashes do you see? Which is latest (`stash@{0}` or `stash@{1}`)?
   - Q2: Which stash has `notes.txt`? How do you know?

4. Run:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   git stash list
   ```
   - Take 1 screenshot.

5. Answer:
   - Q3: What happened to the stash list after `pop`? (2 lines)

***
# A1
1-> I can see 2 Stashes. The latest stash is stash@{0}
2-> stash@{0} has notes.txt file beacuse it was (git stash -u) stash which stashes the untracked files .
3-> the stash list was reduced to only 1 stash which is of modification of readme file after the pop.
   the pop brings back the stashed changes back to the main branch or any any which we are currently in.

### Task A2 — Switch Branch with Half-Done Work (10 mins)

1. Create branch:
   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/login
   ```
2. In this branch:
   - Create `login.html` → commit it.
   - Create `login.css` → stage it (`git add login.css`).
   - Create `login.js` → leave it untracked.

3. You must switch to `main` urgently.  
   Stash your work (include untracked files) with a message:
   ```bash
   git stash -u -m "WIP: login page"
   ```

4. Switch to `main`, make a small change, commit, push:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   # edit README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Small update"
   git push
   ```

5. Go back and restore your work:
   ```bash
   git switch feature/login
   git stash pop
   ```

6. Answer:
   - Q4: Why did you need `git stash` before switching to `main`? (2–3 lines)
   - Q5: Show 1 screenshot of `git stash list` after pop. How many stashes remain?

***

# A2
4-> we need git stash before switching to main because to save our chnages to a temporary location so it don't get removed when we change branch or we have not to forcefully push the half code.

5-> 0 stashes remain.

### Task A3 — Simple Hygiene (5 mins)

1. Make a small change in `README.md`.
2. Stash it with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git stash push -m "BUGFIX: README typo"
   git stash list
   ```
3. Take 1 screenshot.

4. Answer:
   - Q6: Why is using `-m "message"` helpful? (2 lines)

***
# A3

6-> -m "msg" is helpful because we know what was the reason for the stashing.

## Assignment B —  Theoretical  
**Title:** “Stash Concepts”

**Submit:** Write short answers in your notebook.

Answer in 2–4 lines each.

1. What is `git stash` in simple words? When do we use it?  
2. You have:
   - `app.js` (tracked, modified)
   - `test.js` (untracked)
   - `.env` (ignored)

   Which files are stashed by:
   - `git stash`
   - `git stash -u`
   - `git stash -a`

3. Explain the difference between:
   - `git stash apply`
   - `git stash pop`

4. When would you prefer `apply` over `pop`? Give one small example.

5. What do these commands do?
   - `git stash drop`
   - `git stash clear`

6. You see this `git stash list`:
   ```text
   stash@{0}: WIP on feature/login: ...
   stash@{1}: WIP on main: ...
   ```
   - Which is the latest stash?
   - If you run `git stash pop`, which one is removed?

7. Why is it good to use messages like:
   ```bash
   git stash push -m "WIP: login form"
   ```
   instead of just `git stash`? (2–3 lines)

8. Scenario:
   - You are on `feature/checkout`.
   - `checkout.html` is committed.
   - `checkout.css` is staged.
   - `checkout.js` is untracked.

   You must switch to `main` urgently.  
   Write the exact command(s) you will use to stash your work safely (include untracked files and a message).

## Assignment C — (Short Practical + Theory)  
**Title:** “Stash in Action”

**Submit:** Repo with `assignmentC.md` (answers + 2 screenshots).

### Setup (5 mins)

```bash
# Create repo: git-stash-C-<username>
git clone <repo-url>
cd git-stash-C-<username>

echo "# Stash Mixed" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

***

### Part C1 — Practical (10 mins)

1. On `main`:
   - Edit `README.md`.
   - Create `temp.txt` (untracked).

2. Run:
   ```bash
   git stash
   git stash -u
   git stash list
   ```
   - Take 1 screenshot.

3. Answer:
   - Q1: How many stashes? Which one is latest?
   - Q2: Which stash has `temp.txt`?

4. Run:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   git stash list
   ```
   - Take 1 screenshot.

5. Answer:
   - Q3: What changed in the stash list after `pop`? (2 lines)
#C1
***
1-> 2 Stashes . The latest one is stash@{0}.
2-> stash@{0} has temp.txt
3-> stash@{0} is popped and untrack file is back for staging.
    modification is still stashed as the only stash remained.

### Part C2 — Theory (10 mins)

Answer in 2–4 lines each in your notebook.

6. In your own words, what is `git stash` and why is it useful?  

7. Explain with a small example:
   - `git stash apply`
   - `git stash pop`

8. Why should we use `-u` when stashing new files?  

9. Why are meaningful stash messages (like `"WIP: login form"`) important in team projects?  

10. Imagine:
    - You stashed 3 times.
    - You run `git stash pop`.
    - Then you run `git stash drop`.

    How many stashes remain if you started with 3? Explain briefly.
